<p>The game is very simple right now, as I need to make sure the basic mechanics work before <br> 
anything else.</p>
<p>What are those funky meters that reset every 4 seconds: Those are the act meters!'
    When they run out, the selected action is done
</p>
<p>Enemy Attacking: The enemy attacks every 4 seconds, dealing a random amount of damage <br>
between (PH). In the future it will select random attacks from a list, but for now just attacking.</p>
<p>Player Acting: If you select the attack option or the heal option before the meter runs out, once
    the meter runs out you will take that action.
