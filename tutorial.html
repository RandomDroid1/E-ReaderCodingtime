<p class="TutorialText">The game is very simple right now, as I need to make sure the basic mechanics work before <br> 
anything else.</p>
<p>What are those funky meters that reset every 4 seconds: Those are the act meters!'
    When they run out, the selected action is done. The enemy technically acts first by a fraction of seconds
</p>
<p class="TutorialText">Enemy Attacking: The enemy attacks every 4 seconds, dealing a random amount of damage <br>
between 10 and 75 damage. In the future it will select random attacks from a list, but for now just attacking.</p>
<p class="TutorialText">Player Acting: If you select the attack option or the heal option before the meter runs out, once
    the meter runs out you will take that action. If you don't select anything, nothing happens.
</p>
<p class="TutorialText">Extra Notes: Because the enemy technically attacks first (particularly apparent in cases of healing when the enemy strikes you dead being impossible), the player gets 150 health instead of 100.</p>
